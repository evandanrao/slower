#Convex Decomposer Params
cvx: #This helps you call it in the get_param : call it as rospy.get_param("~cvx/angle_lim") # angle below which planes have to be merged into one
#That way the param is accessible even if its loaded by a different node.

# Local Planner Params
lp:
  freq: 10 # Local replan rate [Hz]

  v_max: 3.0 # Speed constraint in local plan [m/s]
  a_max: 10.0 # Acceleration constraint in local plan [m/s2]
  j_max: 50.0 # Jerk constraint in local plan [m/s3]

  n_seg: 10  # Number of cubic spline segments in local plan trajectory
  n_int_max: 5 # Maximum number of JPS intervals/polyhedra considered
  n_plane_max: 8 # Maximum number of polyhedron planes considered per interval

  goal_FOV: 120 # FOV angle local planner will keep goal location within [deg]

depth_max: 5.0 #[m] In the depth image, points farther than depth_max, are treated as inf (i.e. along its ray (and up to that point) only unknown voxels are cleared. If doing simulation, this should be the value of pointCloudCutoffMax in the file `asus_camera_urdf.xacro`
